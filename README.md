# kadence *kademlia primitives for building p2p networks*

Kadence is a complete implementation of the 
[Kademlia](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/%7Edm/home/papers/kpos.pdf) distributed 
hash table. Kadence provides developers of distributed systems a 
set of primitives for inventing new protocols on a solid, well-tested base.

```
npm install @tacticalchihuahua/kadence
```

## example

```js

```

## research

Kadence has been used in academic research on distributed systems over the years.
